#IDEAs


CHANNELS ARE BASICLY GROUPS? USE INDEX TO GROUP THEM VISUALLY?

- Add humanize knob

- Use Oscilloscope's frequency for visuals

- Make multiple synthesizers at the same time


- on disconnecting nodes or anything ramp down volume of affected track

- Enter fullscreen mode and disable all UI

- velocity knob?
- Midi has velocity

- Master track no instrument, but add effects before gain out
- Show ADSR 
- drum machine generator
  set: drum parts (hihat, snare etc) 
       random (aber im takt) or steady 4/4 8/8 2/4 etc or 16 bars triggering triggering
  Make sampler with predefined drums 
       

- loop mode recording - set a loop length and start record and play. loop runns and playing will overdub. also make undo 


- Loop recordings?
- Add knob automation (startVal, endVal, curve, duration)

- upload presets to database? 


- Add different colors for different octaves (only for black keys?)
- hide keyboard
- Mode - random octaves on all keys (changes after pressed?)
- Pressing keys changes the color of the background/keys. Colors are chose by my synesthesia palette
- moodlight background easy smoothly between colors
