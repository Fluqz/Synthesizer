#BUGS

- I think the effects are not really chaining correctly. The sound on play sounds different than the delayed sound.??


#Unfinished

- dropdown delete with ::after
- dropdown label text variable instead of selected
- two tween functions combine


#IDEAs


- drum machine generator
  set: drum parts (hihat, snare etc) 
       random (aber im takt) or steady 4/4 8/8 2/4 etc or 16 bars triggering triggering
       
- hide keyboard
- random octaves on keys
- loop mode recording - set a loop length and start record and play. loop runns and playing will overdub. also make undo 
- change wave
- Record what youre playing in midi notes?
- Loop recordings?
- Add different colors for different octaves (only for black keys?)
- Add knob automation (startVal, endVal, curve, duration)
- Pressing keys changes the color of the background/keys. Colors are chose by my synesthesia palette
