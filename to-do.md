#BUGS

- I think the effects are not really chaining correctly. The sound on play sounds different than the delayed sound.??


#Unfinished

- Knob is still weird

- dropdown delete with ::after
- dropdown label text variable instead of selected
- two tween functions combine
- osc is stopping itself when going from one key to another

#NiceToHave

- random octaves on keys
- loop mode recording - set a loop length and start record and play. loop runns and playing will overdub. also make undo 
- change wave
- Would be nice to have channels. Basicly having multple keyboards with a effectchain and properties for each.
- Record what you playing like midi notes?
- Loop recordings?
- Envelope - Every synth has different envelopes and/or multiple. Cannot access them consitently
- Add filters
- Add different colors for different octaves (only for black keys?)
- Add knob automation with filters
- Add arppegiator mode
- Pressing keys changes the color of the background/keys. Colors are chose by my synesthesia palette
