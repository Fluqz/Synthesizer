#BUGS

I think the effects are not really chaining correctly. The sound on play sounds different than the delayed sound.??

#Unfinished

Record and export not working
Knob is still weird
Knob rotation not updating on scroll


#NiceToHave

change wave

Would be nice to have channels. Basicly having multple keyboards with a effectchain and properties for each.

Record what you playing like midi notes?

Loop recordings?

Envelope


Add filters

Add knob automation with filters
Add arppegiator mode
